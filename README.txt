Reasoning behind file names:
- Client is named as such because it represents the client algorithm.
  It deals with creating read, write, and invalid requests and receiving from server based on request type.
- Intermediate is named as such because the class represents the intermediate host between client and server.
- Server is named as such because the class represents the server algorithm.
- SharedMemory is named as such because it's a copy of the Box class seen in the lectures.
